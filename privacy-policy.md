Reddit Filter Privacy Policy

Data Collection and Usage:
Reddit Filter does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or browsing data to external servers. All user preferences (keywords and toggle settings) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API and never leave your device.

Third-Party Services:
This extension does not use any third-party analytics, tracking services, or advertisements.

Information Access:
The extension only accesses the content of Reddit pages to apply your filtering preferences. It reads post title, subreddit name, and recommendation source attributes solely to determine which posts to hide based on your settings.

Changes to This Policy:
Any future changes to this privacy policy will be updated with the extension and noted in the changelog.

Open Source:
Reddit Filter is free and open-source software. The complete source code is available on GitHub, allowing anyone to verify its privacy and security practices.
